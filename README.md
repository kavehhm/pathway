## Stripe Integration

This project includes Stripe payment integration for booking tutoring sessions. To set up Stripe:

1. Create a Stripe account at [stripe.com](https://stripe.com)
2. Get your API keys from the Stripe Dashboard
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_stripe_secret_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_stripe_publishable_key_here
```

4. Replace the placeholder values with your actual Stripe API keys
5. For production, use the live keys instead of test keys

### Payment Flow

1. User selects a date and time for tutoring
2. Clicks "Book Now" to proceed to payment
3. Enters payment information using Stripe Elements
4. Payment is processed through Stripe
5. On successful payment, the booking is created in the database
6. User receives confirmation and the booked time is marked as unavailable
